This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with the following error message: `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.ResourceCompilerTool$ResourceCompilationRunnable > Android resource compilation failed`This error is often caused by issues with the app's resources (images, layouts, etc.), such as missing files or conflicting resource names.  The error message itself is not very specific and can be difficult to debug.  The actual underlying cause can vary greatly.
