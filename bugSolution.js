The solution to this type of error requires careful examination of the app's resources.  Often, a thorough review will find duplicate resource names, an improperly formatted XML file, or a missing resource file. Here are steps to approach debugging:

1. **Clean the Project:** Before making any changes, run the following to clean up old build files that might cause conflicts:
   ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```
2. **Check for Duplicate Resource Names:** Carefully review your `android/app/src/main/res` directory for duplicate images, layout files (e.g. `layout/activity_main.xml`), or other resources.  Two files with the same name, even in different folders, will cause errors.
3. **Inspect Resource Files:** Examine all the files in the `android/app/src/main/res` directory thoroughly. Verify that:
    * All images are in valid formats (PNG, JPG, etc.).
    * XML files are correctly formatted and validated.
    * No files have any unsupported characters in their names.
4. **Validate XML Files:** Carefully check your layout files (`.xml`) for any syntax errors. Even a small mistake can prevent the build process from completing successfully. A good XML validator can be immensely helpful.
5. **Rebuild:** After addressing any identified issues, try building the project again: 
   ```bash
expo build:android
```
If the issue persists, please provide more details about your project structure and the resources in use.
